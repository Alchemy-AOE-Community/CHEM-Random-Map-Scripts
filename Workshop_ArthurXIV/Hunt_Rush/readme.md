### Description
This map features a large unconstructible battlefield in the center so that armies cannot easily retreat to a nearby castle or tower.
Make sure to mess with your ennemies while they try to lure elephants from the center.

### Introduction
This strange island located in a swampy area homes a wild variety of fauna and
vestige. Far from the coast, the very dry land is occupied only by a few zebra
and a vast pack of elephants.
