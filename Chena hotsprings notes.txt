I enjoyed the map and I think it somewhat gets rid the most common nomad issue: castle drops being too strong. There isn't too much space to drop a castle on the opponent's face because of the many small woodlines and the water in the middle, which I like.
One issue I could see is Huns being slightly overtuned on this one: they normally cannot build a dock on standard nomad because of the starting wood, but on this map not only do they start with a dock but they also have enough wood to make a fishing ship right at the start (they don't need houses), with 25 wood left in the bank. Fortunately they do not have access to an unfairly strong castle age unit like Spanish do so they might not be able to capitalise too much on a strong start, but it's still something to keep in mind.
Feudal aggression is doable, but it all comes down to how much each player uses the water in the middle. I can see archers sneaking in the back of a player's base and doing some considerable damage.
Towers in feudal might actually be more viable than standard nomad, because there much less access to fish.
