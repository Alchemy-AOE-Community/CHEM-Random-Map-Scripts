### Disclaimers
> Due to a bug with sharing .xs scripts in lobbies, EVERY TIME you open a lobby with the intent of playing a map that uses .xs scripts, select an official map (e.g. Arabia, Arena, etc) then (re-)select the custom map. Otherwise the script won't be shared with other players and they will encounter an error at the start of the game.
(If this bug is too annoying to you, just don't download my .xs scripts and remove their call at the very beginning of my .rms scripts. My .xs are not important anymore, currently they only print text.)

Please place these .xs files directly (not the folder) in
<p style="background:black">
<code style="background:black;color:white">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\resources\_common\xs\
</code>
</p>
or
<p style="background:black">
<code style="background:black;color:white">C:\Users\<Username>\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\<numeric ID>\resources\_common\xs
</code>
</p>
so that the .rms scripts can load them.

### Old comment
> I deactivated my .xs scripts since i didn't find any way to pass them to other players with the .rms through the lobby.
> I will have to make a mod if i want to use these scripts in multiplayer games.
