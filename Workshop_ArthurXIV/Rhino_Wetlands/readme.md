### Description
My intent when building this map was to make thin player islands with all their resources pulled towards the shore, so that warships become a huge threat.
Of course since warships are already overpowered in AOE2 i had to balance that power. That's why their cost is x2.
I also wanted players to be able to sneak base raids using a path around the edges of the map. This probably won't be efficient at all but it's feasible.

### Introduction
This archipelago is centered around an island covered with a dense forest. Adventurers who managed to penetrate this forest distinctly remember facing a throng of rhinos and fleeing by boat immediately.
