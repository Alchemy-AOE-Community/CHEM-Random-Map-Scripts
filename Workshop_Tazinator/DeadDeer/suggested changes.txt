More neutral resources like gold and stone

1 tile gold and stones in the center

Make the deer gimmick last longer, after 7 minutes it became a super open map, unless you full on turtle shell you cant really wall. (Ill double the food)

its too open

there's no woodlines in the center

make the middle more interesting

bigger woodlines on map

edge hill:: make it farther back

TAZ

Should I try a living Deer hill? 

I used to have a deer spawner map on Userpatch, I don't know if it works in DE (The feature was that deer ran towards 0,0 using the deer spawning with a unit on the same space glitch)
