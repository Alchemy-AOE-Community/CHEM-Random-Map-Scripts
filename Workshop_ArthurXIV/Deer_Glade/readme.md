### Description
My goal with this map was to have a sparse forest in the center where archers can slowly progress while cavalry raids bases by circling around that forest.
I also wanted this center forest to be inhabited only by deer, so i pushed boars further towards the edges of the map.

### Introduction
This green island located in a swampy area homes a throng of deer. You may find
them if you wander through the birch brush.
