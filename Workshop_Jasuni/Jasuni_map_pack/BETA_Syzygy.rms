/* Syzygy */
/* A Random Map Script initially started by BPDrej, but mostly finished by Jasuni

Title: Syzygy
Authors: Jasuni (primary), BPDrej (started script, secondary)
Date: March 2024
Notice: Map developed for Alchemy League Season 2 at their request and may be used for it (and any other tournaments that wish to use it may do so, but I request a notification from any doing so).
Spec: https://github.com/TechnicalChariot/Alchemy-AOE-Published-Specifications/blob/main/CHEM-CSRM-HVN-07.pdf

idea: randomize the terrains for each planet so that players have to scout it out - nomad start, with 1 vil on top planet, 1 vil bottom planet, and 1 vil somewhere else (place via actor area?) Could also have players start with a fishing ship (good for scouting) in a map corner (either top/bottom or left/right: likely left/right)
Syzygy randomizing: when selecting terrains, do a random chance for first 1, then random chance with one removed (remove last 1, check for duplicate) for second planet; 3rd planet remove last 2, if get duplicate check which planet it was (first removed if first planet, otherwise second); remove 3 for last planet (handle like 3rd planet)

ideas implemented:
Barren (guarantee gold/stone, gravel terrain with rock and desert gravel terrain mask; no trees, no food, but will have stone (often in abundance) and an randomized amount of gold. Biased towards having a larger amount of stone than of gold.
Radioactive (evil fog mostly under desert gravel terrain, have fish/wildlife/vils avoid the terrain through use of actor areas - no food/wood, stone randomized with a good chance of no stone, gold guaranteed but widely varies. May be extremely gold-rich, may be gold-poor)
Desert: has desert palm trees, some thematic hunts (rhinos, ostrichs, elephants), gold and (probably) stone, and a small chance of a dromedary scout
Farmland: Has berry bushes of both kinds, livestock (1 random type of herdable), mediterranean forest, low/no stone, low/no gold

terrain ideas yet to be added: 
City (Road terrain, has forests, berry bushes, neutral capturable outposts, neutral trading posts, and ruins of buildings - would include stone piles, possibly in some alternative form. Also may include gold piles - guaranteed extra relics on this terrain)
Marsh (mangrove forest terrain? mangrove terrain should be separated from outside of the planet, but would have plenty of wood and food/berries/hunt. May have some gold. No stone. Predators fit thematically, but nomad start prohibits that).
Jungle terrain: (lush jungle forests, plenty of wildlife, maybe a little gold, no stone)
Grassland/plains: has horses (give players a wild horse that only starts on this terrain as a scout). Has some trees, but not too many. Plenty of hunt.

Mountains/alpine (have mountains take up some space; plenty of stone and gold, trees, goats, etc. - would also have some elevation - use Snow light terrain as base)
Snowy: (some wildlife to hunt, dead forests, some gold/stone, but not an abundance)


TODO consider removing photon scout (perhaps leave in irradiated planet with a chance of it spawning there)

terrains that I could use:
GRASS, GRASS2, GRASS3, DIRT, DIRT2, DIRT3, DLC_DIRT4, LEAVES, FARM (several, but probably only want 1), DESERT, ROAD (would require change in resource terrain table, pair with ROAD2 which is broken road), SNOW, snow_foundation (4th snow terrain, should looklike snow dirt), DLC_SAVANNAH, DLC_CRACKED, DLC_QUICKSAND (would require change in resource terrain table), DLC_JUNGLEGRASS, Corruption, Gravel, underbrush-leaves, underbrush-snow, (see defined terrains)..., DLC_DRYGRASS, DLC_BOGLAND (require change in resource terrain table), DLC_DESERTGRAVEL
DLC_ROADGRAVEL
tricky terrains: DLC_MANGROVESHALLOW, rice farm terrains
obsolete terrains that don't layer: DIRT_SNOW, GRASS_SNOW, DLC_DRYROAD, DLC_MOORLAND, DLC_JUNGLEROAD, DLC_JUNGLELEAVES
not really usable as a base terrain: DLC_ROCK, ICE, MUDDY_SHALLOW

forest terrains: JUNGLE, BAMBOO, etc.

terrains made/used: 
	Farmland
	Barren (Gravel)
	Evil Fog
	Desert
	Dirt
	Snow heavy (mountainous biome)
	Dirt4 (forest biome)
	Savannah
	Leaves (forest biome)
	Snow (forest biome)
	Bogland (mangrove)
	Dirt Mud (mangrove and muddy water; forest biome)
	Road

	GRASS, LEAVES, DIRT,  DESERT, ROAD, farm 0%, SNOW, DLC_SAVANNAH, DLC_DIRT4, Corruption, GRAVEL, SNOW_HEAVY, DIRT_MUD, DLC_BOGLAND,
	 

	UNDERBRUSH_LEAVES - used as backup terrain, aka jungle biome: not a functional biome at this point, but could be turned into one.

still available:
	GRASS, GRASS2, GRASS3, DIRT2, DIRT3, DLC_CRACKED, DLC_QUICKSAND, DLC_JUNGLEGRASS, DLC_DRYGRASS, DLC_DESERTGRAVEL, DLC_ROADGRAVEL, and any forest terrains*, ROCK1 (grass placed under cliffs), Grass foundation (put under buildings), ICE?, DLC_ROCK (probably best to avoid, since used to fill gaps between planets), DLC_BLACK? (probably best to avoid for similar reasons), SNOW_LIGHT, moddable lands? (check if used in terrain generaiton), 

	potentially other farmland terrains, and other road terrains (ROAD2, ), and snow_foundation
	need to check: underbrush-leaves, underbrush-snow, DIRT_SNOW, GRASS_SNOW, DLC_DRYROAD, DLC_MOORLAND, DLC_JUNGLEROAD, DLC_JUNGLELEAVES, underbrush-jungle?, 
need to add: great plain, cracked, dry mountain, rainforest

Personal playtest notes: Way overdid it on the food resources from the looks of it. I think that I can safely get rid of the dolphins (probably the shore fish as well).

Feedback from Yo Yo Dude: Space seems like an issue (limit hill elevation) - may be an issue in the mid game. If players start closer, then it should be trush wars. Recommends talking to Randy Pan and Alexander.
	He changed his mind on the elevation, but did mention that there's too much stone/gold on the radioactive/barren planets. Does want me to let him know when I update a new version.

feedback from WarLion: more deep fish needed (not much, but a little would be a good add); likes the varying resource generation, but can result in unbalanced gens (might want to lower the variability and rely less on number of groups and more on temp_min_distance_group_placement - or ask for clarification); majority of vils being right next to each other can cause TCs to be within a few tiles range (so maybe tweak the city to have a few less extra vils)

resulting tweaks: added a little more deep fish (slightly reduced temp_min_distance_group_placement),
Reduce villagers a little for the city biome, also forced them (and houses) away from the planetary villagers.
Force villagers to have a little separation from each other? (perhaps an actor area to avoid - will need to stress-test with the smallest map size)

TODO: idea: if add a cracked terrain without wood, then could have a check for if 3 biomes are woodless (cracked, radiated, barren) - if so, then rocky terrain gets some wood piles placed on them

Rules of object generation for this map (which may need updating):
	1. All animal life (including villagers, hunt, sheep, fish, etc) should avoid actor area 1
	2. Nothing should be placed before the corruption terrain ON_GRIDs (which create actor area 1)
	3. assume that forests may be added to adjacent planets
	4. Gold mines should create actor area 2 with at least radius 3
	5. Stone mines should create actor area 3 with at least radius 3
	6. Gold/stone should avoid actor areas 2 and 3. Actor area 2 is gold mines. 3 is stone mines.

note that there may be a little overflow between planets
