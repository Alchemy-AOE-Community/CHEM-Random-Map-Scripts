A map designed by Mr. Beaver for AOE League 2v2. Features an elevated lake in the north with an undockable shallow river running through the center, and a dry, hilly region in the south that contains all the neutral gold and stone. Teams start vertically in random positions on either side of the river with standard resources, except lower gold and stone count, similar to Gold Rush.
