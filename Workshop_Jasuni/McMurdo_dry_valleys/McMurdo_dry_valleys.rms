Title: McMurdo Dry Valleys
authors: Jasuni (primary), Huehuecoyotl22 (requested map, gave basic concept, provided some code)

Have a few ideas for how to do the McMurdo one. I'm thinking direct placement with players near the water, borders for the terrain, stone piles all on an icy snow terrain (imagine ice fortifications). Not certain where I'd put gold yet. I also recall there being some kind of wood/food stockpile object, which should work for starting resources. I think I'd like to see what I can make for this map.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Dry_Valleys

Here a little bit of water could be used on one side. Penguins and fish would be the only animals. Snow, ice, rocks. No plants, so maybe the shipwrecks etc. like on Antarctic Valley as wood sources.
I don't have many ideas about it yet, but it's the driest place on Earth at the moment.
Maybe a map layout like elevation-valley-elevation-valley-elevation.

basic format (rotated): add water at top of the map
|l|l|


idea: for team/larger games, 1 player can be further in the corner (by the lake). In FFAs, this would leave them in a more defensive postion, but also make it easier to cut them off from the rest of the map.

ex for 3v3:
XWWWWX
OXXXXO
OOOOOO
...


dry valleys: no humidity, lack snow/ice covering
katabatic winds evaporate water/ice/snow (can reach over 200 mph)

I think I may want to craft out a scenario editor map first to get a good idea of what I want it to look like

TODO ensure wood sources aren't deletable (there likely won't be much wood anyways)
determine a good number of shipwrecks and amount of resources needed for them.
Make player starts (either Vils starting near shipwrecks, or alternate between valleys/glaciers) - probably have the nomad start for non-standard team formations (like FFAs), alternate between valley/glaciers for 1v1,2v2,3v3,4v4.

issue: map is very easily lamed: resource nodes can be destroyed by building on top of them.

Blood Falls is really small - basically a tongue on the snow that moves onto dry ground (a very thin strip - like one or two tiles) that then goes onto the water (perhaps red, icy shallows)

So basically have a glacier go to the middle, which is separated from the Lake Bonnie (in the center of the map) by a tile  or two of bedrock. Lake Bonnie is an ice terrain, possibly with a shallows terrain mask. Could add the blood objects for coloring (probably with force_placement, but would need to prolong their survival), or explore using a custom lava terrain as a terrain mask.

Something like: (S is snow, D is dirt/bedrock, W is water/ice, l is blood terrain/lava)

Caveat: Blood falls is on Lake Bonnie, which is on the western end of Taylor Glacier (so opposite of the ocean) - or more likely, Taylor Glacier doesn't extend to the water, so I could have a small lake in the middle of the map. Would it be possible to make a long-lasting (permanent) blood object that I could use as a covering? Or I could use the corruption terrain (it glows red, which is quite fitting here, but is too black for my liking)

gravel with rock terrain mask? Look through the terrain scenario mod
rock terrain is a little too green for my liking here

Gravel Desert mixed with Dirt (mud)
or Gravel mixed with Dirt (mud)

Gravel with beach (wet gravel)
note: beach (wet rock) is like rock terrain - has a touch of greenery to it
beach (wet) mixed with a gravel terrain is a bit off

idea: players on the snow start with a different setup than players on the bedrock. I'm thinking something like the bedrock players start a certain distance from the water, and the snow bank player starts with a castle. Implementation would be something along these lines: TC with max distance 0 on snow terrain with a actor area. Temp object with max distance 0 that avoids the TC actor area and has its own actor area. Shipwreck on water/beach using find_closest to create a new actor area for players not on the snow. TC placed in the water object's actor area (for bedrock players) that has another actor area (which is used for object placement). Castle placed on snow terrain with find_closest_to_map_center, within snow TC actor area, and with a max_distance_to_player attribute that ensures only the snowbank players get a castle.
Giving the snowbank players a castle (essentially the back player) should give them extra strategic options, since they would have an easier time providing support with their unique unit or getting their UT than other players will. 

TCs have been moved farther from shore (as per feedback), but I may consider undoing the special system I've set up in favor of always using the natural player spot.
TODO consider moving neutral gold to snow terrain? There may be advantages to having the elevated terrain lack resources (would make good farmland, for example, since little else would want to be there). The iron from blood falls would also be under a glacier, so there is some logical reason for the snow to be on the snow.

known issue: wood piles can be lamed

TODO had a generation where relatively little gold spawned on Bonney lake. It appears that how much gold spawns is somewhat inconsistent, with it sometimes spawning on the whole lake and sometimes missing large portions of it.

Actor area notes:
different objects can be assigned to the same actor area
Don't place origin-referenced (player/land_id) objects in generic actor areas

Placing generic/player objects into land-id-referenced actor areas works (i.e. actor area from an object that was placed on a specific land id)

Only player objects should be placed in player-based actor areas

generic objects in generic actor areas: minimize commands between actor area creation and object creation

if all else fails, avoid_actor_area works well (as an inverse actor area)
