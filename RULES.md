COLLABORATION RULES:

1) DON'T CREATE CONFUSING DUBPLICATES -- ALWAYS create new branches based on the "_Empty_" branch. Failure to do so may result in duplicate code that can cause merge conflicts and be a headache for all.
2) A BRANCH YOU OWN IS YOUR CASTLE    -- ALWAYS check with the owner of the branch before changing any random map script within. Collaboration is good but there might be a reason why somebody has set something up a certain way. Be sure to make sure your improvement ideas are welcome.
3) DO NOT AIR THE DIRTY LAUNDRY       -- The repository is intended as a place where people can release milestones --somebody doing a big part, and then sharing with somebody else to do another part. etc. It's not a place to commit 100s of different different changes as you build from scratch. Get a good start, and release the map publicly when it is done, or if you get stuck somewhere and want to share the code to get help.
4) DOG TAGS                           -- Your random map scripts should contain information about who made what, when work began, and any exemptions to the general license agreement for this repository. (E. G. "Permission to use this map in tournament XXX"). All listed collaborators must agree with those exemptions.
5) ENTIRE-LIBRARY BRANCH IS A TEMPLE  -- NEVER commit to the "entire-library" branch EXCEPT to merge other branches that you own into it. Failure to uphold this rule will create merge conflicts and other issues.
