CHANGES MADE ON (DD/MM/YY) 01.10.21:
    • <ELEVATION_GENERATION>  (Reduced number of hills to make starting town center easier to place)
    • Excepting the creation of elevation 1, reduced “number of tiles” for all “create_elevation” commands by 25%, rounded down.
    • <OBJECTS_GENERATION> Removal of Villager and Fishing Ship manual object scribe. Included in Object_Database.ods:
        ◦ Added Row #49 VILLAGER_BASE_F with the following parameters:
            ▪ Object Type: Player Assigned Player Owned
            ▪ Group Quantity: 3
            ▪ Grouping Type: Tight
            ▪ Scaling Type: None
            ▪ Min Distance Group Placement 16
            ▪ Temp Min Distance Group Placement 32
            ▪ Rows to Avoid: 8,9,10,11   (all fish: shore, water, med_water, & deep_water)
            ▪ Avoidance Distance: 8,8,8,8
            ▪ Force Placement: Yes
            ▪ Manually removed “find_closest” from auto-generated code
        ◦ Added Row #50 FISHING_SHIP with the following parameters:
            ▪ Object Type: Player Assigned Player Owned
            ▪ Grouping Type: Tight
            ▪ Scaling Type: None
            ▪ Min Distance Group Placement 16
            ▪ Force Placement: Yes
            ▪ Manually removed “find_closest” from auto-generated code
CHANGES MADE ON (DD/MM/YY) 13.10.21:
Nature/Reason:
    • Current code allows villagers to be trapped inside forests, which is unacceptable since players could start with a different number of use-able villagers. This change will give all starting villagers forest avoidance, so it is impossible for them to become trapped. 
    • Kings may spawn on the water, making them vulnerable to being trapped and sniped by enemy units. This change forces kings to spawn on beach terrain.
    • Rather than having a free fishing ship (which may not sufficiently nerf Persians and Malians), all civilizations are given +50 starting wood so they can at least afford the dock and town center. A free transport ship with reduced vision is instead given to each player to encourage relic collection and sneak landings.
    • On some larger generations of the previous map revision, cosmetic defects would be present – grass would be left where terrain layering should have converted it to rock. This change removes these visual bugs by improving the probability that the correct terrain is applied uniformly. 
Details:
    • <PLAYER_SETUP>
        ◦ After the effect_amount setting wood amount contained by trees, but before <ELEVATION_GENERATION> added the following lines of code:
/* Modify Player Starting Resources */
	effect_amount MOD_RESOURCE AMOUNT_STARTING_WOOD ATTR_ADD 50
	/* Setting Transport Ship LOS */
	#const SFTS 1735 /* Sicilian Free Transport Ship */
	effect_amount SET_ATTRIBUTE SFTS ATTR_LINE_OF_SIGHT 1
    • <ELEVATION_GENERATION>
        ◦ Under “create_elevation 1”
            ▪ “number_of_clumps” revised FROM “9320” TO “40”.
    • <TERRAIN_GENERATION>
        ◦ Increase the number of instances of “create_terrain NNRB” FROM 1 TO 2. All other parameter kept the same. 
    • <OBJECTS_GENERATION> 
        ◦ Added forest avoidance of villagers through ObjectDatabase.ods
            ▪ Row 49 Column T (Forest Distance): Added “2”.
            ▪ Updated by running ObjectAutoscribeV5.m, instead of ObjectAutoscribeV4.m
        ◦ Before “/* BEGIN_OBJECTS_AUTOSCRIBE */”, in king creation script for regicide, added the following text after “set_place_for_every_player”: “terrain_to_place_on NNRB”
        ◦ Modified starting units thusly through ObjectDatabase.ods
            ▪ Row 50, Column B (First Object) revised FROM “FISHING_SHIP” TO “SFTS”
                • Housekeeping: Manually removed “find_closest” from auto-generated code.
