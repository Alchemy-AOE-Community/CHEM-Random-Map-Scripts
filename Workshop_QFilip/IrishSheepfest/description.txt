Irish Sheepfest:
Players start with only 2 sheeps and 1 Boar and 3 deers (but they're not groupped and are placed quite far from TC). There is convertible mill for each player (with 1 sheep next to it) where players can train sheeps for 20 wood with training time of 25 seconds. Other than that there is no additional food on the map. On the road there are relics and there is plenty gaia walls which can be used to help players to wall their base (walls are inconvertible).
Suitable for: 1-8 vs 1-8
